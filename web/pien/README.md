# note again

## Description

I wrote another note service, and showed it to my nerd friend,
and the guy told me that it's still vulnerable. WHY?

He must know exactly when I started the server? hmm? Am I wrong?

NOTE: Our server is weak. No DoS please 😭
(The intended soluation does NOT require any DoS)

NOTE2: The server can be reset without any notification.
